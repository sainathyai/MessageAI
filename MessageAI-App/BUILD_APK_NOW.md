- ✅ Auto-increments version code
- ✅ Can be submitted to Google Play Store later
- ✅ Same as what users would download

## Build Options Explained:

| Profile | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **development** | Dev Client with hot reload | Active development only |
| **preview** | Internal testing | Quick testing of changes |
| **production** | Final release version | Real app for users ✅ |

## ⏱️ Build Time

The build will take **10-15 minutes** in the cloud. You'll get a download link when complete.

## 📱 After the Build

1. Download the APK from the link EAS provides
2. Transfer to your Android phone via USB or cloud storage
3. Install the APK
4. Test all features:
   - ✅ Firebase Authentication
   - ✅ Real-time messaging
   - ✅ AI features (translation, smart replies, etc.)
   - ✅ Push notifications

## 🔐 IMPORTANT: Add SHA-1 to Firebase

**Your SHA-1 Fingerprint:**
```
2B:24:60:79:DF:69:B7:FD:39:B1:1F:88:61:73:D2:EB:36:2A:A5:BB
```

**Add it here:**
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/messageai-19a09/settings/general
2. Scroll to "Your apps" section
3. Find Android app (com.messageai.app)
4. Click "Add fingerprint"
5. Paste: `2B:24:60:79:DF:69:B7:FD:39:B1:1F:88:61:73:D2:EB:36:2A:A5:BB`
6. Click "Save"
7. **Wait 10 minutes** for Firebase to propagate changes

## 🎯 Alternative: Preview Build (Faster Testing)

If you just want to quickly test changes, use preview:

```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

Both preview and production create standalone APKs with all features. Production is recommended for final testing and release.

## 📊 Check Build Status

After starting the build, you can:
- Watch progress in terminal
- Check status: `eas build:list`
- View on web: https://expo.dev/accounts/sainathayai/projects/messageai-app/builds

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Run the production build command and you'll have your APK in ~15 minutes!
