# Fix "Connection Refused" on Mobile

## ðŸš¨ Problem
App is running on `127.0.0.1` (localhost) which your phone cannot reach over the network.

## âœ… Solution: Use Tunnel Mode

### Step 1: Stop Current Expo
In your terminal, press **Ctrl + C** to stop the current Expo server.

### Step 2: Navigate to Correct Directory
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Borehole Seismic\Documents\Gauntlet AI\MessageAI\MessageAI-App"
```

### Step 3: Start with Tunnel Mode
```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

**What tunnel mode does:**
- Creates a secure tunnel using ngrok
- Bypasses Windows Firewall completely
- Works from anywhere (not just same WiFi)
- Shows a different URL that works on mobile

### Step 4: Wait for Tunnel
You'll see:
```
â€º Metro waiting on exp://abc-xyz.tunnel.exp.direct:80
â€º Tunnel ready
```

### Step 5: Scan New QR Code
- Open Expo Go on your phone
- Scan the NEW QR code
- App should load!

## Alternative: Try LAN Mode First

If you want to try fixing the network connection instead:

### Option A: Explicitly Use LAN
```bash
npx expo start --lan
```

### Option B: Allow Node.js Through Firewall

**Windows Firewall:**
1. Open Windows Security
2. Firewall & network protection â†’ Allow an app through firewall
3. Find "Node.js" and check both Private and Public
4. If not listed, click "Change settings" â†’ "Allow another app" â†’ Browse to Node.js

**Then restart Expo:**
```bash
npx expo start
```

---

## Why This Happened

**The error in your terminal:**
```
Starting project at C:\Users\Borehole Seismic
ConfigError: Cannot determine the project's Expo SDK version
```

This happened because Expo started in the wrong directory (user home instead of MessageAI-App).

**The manifest shows:**
```
"hostUri":"127.0.0.1:8081"
```

127.0.0.1 = localhost = only accessible from your PC, not your phone.

## âœ… Quick Commands

**RECOMMENDED (Tunnel - Always Works):**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Borehole Seismic\Documents\Gauntlet AI\MessageAI\MessageAI-App"
npx expo start --tunnel
```

**Alternative (LAN - If Firewall Allows):**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Borehole Seismic\Documents\Gauntlet AI\MessageAI\MessageAI-App"
npx expo start --lan
```

**If Both Fail (Reinstall and Try):**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Borehole Seismic\Documents\Gauntlet AI\MessageAI\MessageAI-App"
npm install
npx expo start --tunnel
```

---

## Expected Result

**With Tunnel:**
- URL: `exp://something.tunnel.exp.direct:80`
- Scan QR code â†’ App loads on phone
- No firewall issues

**With LAN (if firewall allows):**
- URL: `exp://192.168.x.x:8081` (your PC's IP)
- Scan QR code â†’ App loads on phone

## Next Steps After It Connects

1. âœ… App loads to Login screen
2. âœ… Tap "Sign Up"
3. âœ… Create account: test@example.com / test123
4. âœ… Should navigate to home screen
5. âœ… Check Firebase console for user data

---

## Troubleshooting Tunnel Mode

**If tunnel is slow:**
- Normal! Tunnel adds latency
- Good for testing, not ideal for active development
- Once you verify it works, fix firewall for LAN mode

**If tunnel fails to start:**
```bash
# Clear cache and try again
npx expo start --tunnel --clear
```

**If you see "Tunnel connection failed":**
- Check internet connection
- Try again (sometimes ngrok is busy)
- Use LAN mode instead if you fix firewall

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Bottom Line

**Right now, do this:**

1. Stop current Expo (Ctrl + C)
2. Run: 
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\Borehole Seismic\Documents\Gauntlet AI\MessageAI\MessageAI-App"
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```
3. Wait for "Tunnel ready"
4. Scan QR code with Expo Go
5. App should load! ðŸš€
