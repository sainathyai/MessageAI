## 🌐 Feature 1: Real-Time Translation

### How It Works

1. Go to any chat conversation
2. Send or receive a message
3. Each message has a small **🌐 Translate** button below it
4. Click **Translate** → AI translates to your preferred language
5. Click **Original** → Shows original text again

### What's Happening Behind the Scenes

```typescript
// MessageBubble component calls translation service
const result = await translateMessage(
  message.text,           // Original message
  userPreferredLanguage,  // Target language (from settings)
  message.id              // For caching
);

// Result contains:
// - translation: "Translated text"
// - detectedLanguage: "es" (source language ISO code)
// - confidence: 0.95 (optional)
```

### Testing Steps

1. **Setup**:
   - Go to Profile → AI Features
   - Set "Preferred Language" to something other than English (e.g., Spanish)

2. **Test incoming message**:
   - Have a friend send you "Hello, how are you?"
   - Click 🌐 Translate
   - You should see: "Hola, ¿cómo estás?" (in Spanish)
   - Badge shows: "🌐 Translated from EN"

3. **Test your own message**:
   - Send "Thank you very much"
   - Click 🌐 Translate on your sent message
   - Should translate to target language

4. **Test caching**:
   - Translate a message
   - Toggle back to "Original"
   - Click "Translate" again → **Instant** (no API call, uses SQLite cache)

### Supported Languages

**25+ languages including**:
- English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de)
- Chinese (zh), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko)
- Arabic (ar), Hindi (hi), Russian (ru)
- And 15+ more (see `translation.service.ts`)

### Visual Flow

```
[Message: "Hello, how are you?"]
      ↓
[ 🌐 Translate ] ← Click
      ↓
[Loading spinner...]
      ↓
[ 🌐 Translated from EN ]
[Message: "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"]
      ↓
[ 🌐 Original ] ← Click to toggle back
```

## 🌍 Feature 2: Language Detection & Auto-Translate

### How It Works

When auto-translate is enabled in settings:
1. Incoming messages are automatically analyzed
2. If language differs from your preferred language
3. Message is auto-translated immediately
4. You see translated version by default

### Testing Steps

1. **Enable auto-translate**:
   - Go to Profile → AI Features
   - Toggle "Auto-translate messages" to ON
   - Set preferred language to "English"

2. **Test with foreign language**:
   - Have friend send: "Bonjour, comment ça va?"
   - Message should automatically show in English
   - Badge shows: "🌐 Translated from FR"

3. **Test with same language**:
   - Have friend send: "Hello friend"
   - Should **not** auto-translate (same language)
   - No badge shown

**Note**: Auto-translate is currently implemented in PR #16 (next PR). For now, manual translation works.

## 📝 Feature 3: Cultural Context Hints

### How It Works

Detects cultural references, idioms, and context-specific phrases, providing explanations:
- **Cultural references**: "It's raining cats and dogs" → idiom explanation
- **Regional expressions**: "Bob's your uncle" (British) → meaning
- **Historical context**: References to events, traditions, etc.

### API Example

```typescript
const context = await analyzeCulturalContext(
  "Break a leg!", 
  "en"
);

// Returns:
{
  hasCulturalContext: true,
  explanation: "Theater idiom wishing good luck",
  literalMeaning: "Injure your leg",
  culturalSignificance: "Originated from theater superstition...",
  appropriateResponse: "Thank you! or I will!"
}
```

### Testing Steps (PR #17)

1. Send a message with idiom: "It's raining cats and dogs"
2. Long-press the message
3. AI Context Menu appears
4. Select "🌍 Cultural Context"
5. See explanation modal

**Status**: Implemented in services, UI integration in PR #17.

## 🎩 Feature 4: Formality Level Adjustment

### How It Works

Rewrites messages to match desired formality:
- **Casual**: "Hey, what's up?"
- **Neutral**: "Hello, how are you?"
- **Formal**: "Good morning, how may I assist you?"
- **Very Formal**: "Greetings, I would be honored to provide assistance."

### API Example

```typescript
const adjusted = await adjustFormality(
  "Hey buddy, thanks a lot!",
  'very_formal',
  'en'
);

// Returns:
{
  original: "Hey buddy, thanks a lot!",
  adjusted: "Dear colleague, I sincerely appreciate your assistance.",
  level: 'very_formal',
  language: 'en'
}
```

### Testing Steps (PR #18)

1. Type a message: "hey, need help asap"
2. Long-press before sending
3. Select "📝 Make Formal"
4. Message rewrites to: "Hello, I require assistance at your earliest convenience."
5. Send or edit further

**Status**: Implemented in services, UI integration in PR #18.

## 🗣️ Feature 5: Slang/Idiom Explanations

### How It Works

Highlights and explains slang terms, idioms, and colloquialisms:

### API Example

```typescript
const terms = await detectSlangAndIdioms(
  "That's lit! Let's bounce.", 
  "en"
);

// Returns array:
[
  {
    term: "lit",
    position: [7, 10],
    type: "slang",
    explanation: "Exciting, amazing, or excellent",
    actualMeaning: "This is very good",
    example: "That party was lit!",
    region: "US",
    formality: "casual"
  },
  {
    term: "bounce",
    position: [18, 24],
    type: "slang",
    explanation: "To leave or depart",
    actualMeaning: "Let's go",
    example: "Time to bounce from this place",
    region: "US",
    formality: "casual"
  }
]
```

### Testing Steps (PR #19)

1. Receive message: "That's dope! Catch you later, fam."
2. Underlined/highlighted words: "dope", "Catch you later", "fam"
3. Tap highlighted term
4. See explanation popup:
   - **Term**: dope

## 💡 Feature 6: Context-Aware Smart Replies (Advanced)

### How It Works

AI analyzes your conversation history and communication style to generate personalized quick replies.

### Communication Style Learning

The AI learns:
- **Sentence length**: Short (5 words) vs Long (20+ words)
- **Emoji usage**: None, Rare, Moderate, Frequent
- **Formality level**: Casual, Neutral, Formal
- **Common phrases**: "sounds good", "let me know", etc.
- **Response speed**: Fast (<30s), Moderate (<2min), Slow (>2min)

### Smart Reply Generation

```typescript
const replies = await generateSmartReplies(
  recentMessages,      // Last 10 messages in conversation
  userStyle,           // Learned communication style
  3                    // Number of suggestions
);

// Returns:
[
  { 
    text: "Sounds good! 👍", 
    type: "agreement", 
    confidence: 0.92 
  },
  { 
    text: "When would be a good time?", 
    type: "question", 
    confidence: 0.87 
  },
  { 
    text: "Let me check and get back to you", 
    type: "neutral", 
    confidence: 0.81 
  }
]
```

### Testing Steps (PR #20)

1. Open a conversation with message history
2. At bottom of chat, see 3 smart reply chips:
   - "Sounds great! 😊"
   - "When works for you?"
   - "Let me know"
3. Tap a reply → Auto-fills message input
4. Edit if needed, or send as-is

**Status**: Implemented in services, UI integration in PR #20.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "AI features not configured" warning

**Problem**: `.env` file not loaded
**Solution**:
1. Verify `.env` exists in `MessageAI-App/` directory
2. Check `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...` is present
3. Run `npx expo start --clear` to clear cache
4. Reload app

### Translation fails with "Rate limit exceeded"

**Problem**: Too many requests in 1 minute (limit: 20)
**Solution**:
- Wait 60 seconds
- Rate limiter will reset automatically
- Cached translations don't count toward limit

### Translation shows "API_ERROR"

**Problem**: Invalid API key or OpenAI service issue
**Solution**:
1. Verify API key is correct (starts with `sk-proj-`)
2. Check OpenAI dashboard for account status
3. Ensure billing is set up (OpenAI requires payment method)

### Translations are slow (>10 seconds)

**Problem**: Network latency or OpenAI API slowness
**Solution**:
- Normal response time: 2-4 seconds
- Check internet connection
- OpenAI sometimes has regional latency
- Cached translations are instant

### Language selector doesn't save

**Problem**: AsyncStorage not working
**Solution**:
- Check permissions (should work by default)
- Clear app data and retry
- Web: Check browser localStorage permissions
